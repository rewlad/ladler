  session.sessionKey

isRequested -- no more undo-s for ev-s le by session, only undo-s by merger

concurrency, exceptions, lifecycle:
  exception kills connection
  scopes are mostly connection
  instant/main are selecting by attr
  tx/snapshot scoped values will have lazy resettable wrapper
  instantDB write can only add events
remember times:
  app
  connection
  snapshot / ro Tx
  vDom / dbEvent
  frame / message handling
  mTx / rw Tx


merger connection iteration:
  try-with mainDB rw:
    try
      try-with instantDB read:
        get first with isRequested gt lastMergedId that is not undone;
        handle according to its none|committed by later ev
    finally:
      try-with instantDB rw:
        err: add undo
        not yet committed: add commit

ui do iteration:
  switch mainDB off
  inside dispatch can be:
    try-with instantDB rw: add event
    reset vDom or tx

ui fresh snapshot:
  sessionLastMergedId = gt last committed and merged request for this session --
  -- rev committedSessionId -> for reverse -> rel committedReqId -> until le lastMergedId
